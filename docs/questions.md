1. we are creating the genesis block, who created the initial number of coins ? when are coins in created ? 

- hedera : it created fixed number of Hbars
- find for bitcoin ? i think during mining, relate it to halving.
- what is the merkle root hash of this block
    - since transaction tree is null

prev block -> null

 -> now how do we put it into circulation
 - airdrop
